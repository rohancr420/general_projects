# General_Projects
All sorts of projects that i work on will be documented here from now on. 

I don't have any experience coding with a repository or using git. I've always just rawdogged vscode and just have had random ass folders on my pc with 4 to 5 projects that i make and then forget about.

main issue i had with this basically being a skill issue because im on windows is that things never work how they are supposed to 90% of the time.
A process that should just take 3 seconds ends up taking 4 hours somehow and by the end you end up forgetting what you were trying to do in the first place.

I fixed this by running linux on my pc using WSL. which in itself took multiple hours to setup due to windows shenanigans.
But finally Ive set up a git to just dump my projects into and somehow things are actually working the way they are supposed to on linux for somereason. Neat.
